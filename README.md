# Project GOOD-JOBS

- **Good Jobs** is a project built to develop a job search system that focuses on those who are not eligible for a partner job, so Good Jobs was born to work.
- This is to help people find the right job but not forced by the conditions of the partner.

- And that is **Good Jobs**!
